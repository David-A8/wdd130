                Rexburg might seem like a place with nothing fun or interesting to do. But that is not true. There are
                several hidden gems around Rexburg and in the town itself. In this website you will find information about
                those hidden gems and what activities you could do once you find them. Some of these places are a little 
                hard to find, so this site will help you to know how to get to those places, when they are open, and what 
                things you might want to bring with you to enjoy your visit.

                <h2>Packsaddle Lake</h2>
                <p>Packsaddle Lake is a 5-acre lake in Teton County, Idaho. It's located in the Big Hole Mountains, about 32 miles from Rexburg. The lake is surrounded by forest and has a rope swing and jumping area.</p>
                <p>The Packsaddle Lake Trailhead is on Packsaddle Lake Road in Tetonia. The trail is 0.8 miles out-and-back and is considered moderately challenging. It takes about 29 minutes to complete. The trail is popular for hiking, running, and walking. </p>
                <p>Some say the hike to the lake is relatively easy and not too strenuous. You can actually drive up most of the trail. So, it's up to you if you want a one-hour hike or a 30-minute hike. Either one, it is a hike you must do wether in the summer when everything is green, or in the fall with the trial covered with some snow.</p>

                <h2>Beaver Dick Park</h2>
                <p>Its a 9.5 acre park next to the west bank of the Henry's Fork of the Snake River. At the south end of the park there are over 400 acres of BLM land to hike, hunt and to see wildlife up close. Camping has a 5 day limit every 30 days. There isn't any water to drink so bring in plenty of water.</p>
                <p>Beaver Dick Park is 7 miles west of Rexburg which is out by “R” Mountain.  Henry's Fork River passes next to the campground. Because of this, Beaver Dick is an ideal for fishing and other water sports.  There are also fire pits, pavilions, bathrooms, and a playground.</p>
                <p>Beaver Dick Park also has a boat dock and a floating dock on the Henry's Fork River. However, this is an advanced swimming area because of currents, so wear life jackets. And it is very wise only swimming during lower water flows.</p>

                <h2>Upper Mesa Falls</h2>
                <p>Upper Mesa Falls is a waterfall in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest in Idaho. It's located on the Henrys Fork, about 16 miles from Ashton and around minutes away from Rexburg. The falls are 114 feet tall and 200 feet wide. </p>
                <p>Upper Mesa Falls is as tall as a 10-story building. The falls pour over remnants of an ancient volcanic eruption that covered much of the current US with ash. The falls are accessible by a short walk. The walk is handicapped accessible down to a lookout, but visitors must climb stairs to reach the edge.</p> 
                <p>There is a $5 entrance fee for visitors without a federal lands pass. There is also a $7 Motor Vehicle Entrance Fee (MVEF) per vehicle to visit the park. </p>
