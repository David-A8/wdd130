        No matter what kind of activities you like to do, there is at least one place that will have those things you 
        are attracted to. This website was created by students who have lived in Rexburg for quite some time, 
        therefore the information will be provided from their point of view. Hopefully this website will provide 
        more details and information than any other maps website could offer. We know college students, and 
        we know what they want.

      <h3>Hidden Gems</h3>
      <p>
        Rexburg might seem like a place with nothing fun or interesting to do. But that is not true. There are
        several hidden gems around Rexburg and in the town itself. In this website you will find information about
        those hidden gems and what activities you could do once you find them. Some of these places are a little 
        hard to find, so this site will help you to know how to get to those places, when they are open, and what 
        things you might want to bring with you to enjoy your visit.

      <h3>Seasonal Events</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the year, some special events and seasonal events are held in the Rexburg area. In this 
        website we will keep you updated with those events, when they are held, how to get to their locations 
        and the cost (if any). Our purpose is to help you find fun activities to have a great time even if you only 
        have a free afternoon and not the whole day to drive to more distant places.
