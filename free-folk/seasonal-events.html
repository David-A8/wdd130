                Throughout the year, some special events and seasonal events are held in the Rexburg area. In this 
                website we will keep you updated with those events, when they are held, how to get to their locations 
                and the cost (if any). Our purpose is to help you find fun activities to have a great time even if you only 
                have a free afternoon and not the whole day to drive to more distant places.
