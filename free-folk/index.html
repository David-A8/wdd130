                No matter what kind of activities you like to do, there is at least one place that will have those things you 
                are attracted to. This website was created by students who have lived in Rexburg for quite some time, 
                therefore the information will be provided from their point of view. Hopefully this website will provide 
                more details and information than any other maps website could offer. We know college students, and 
                we know what they want.
